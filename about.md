# About

## What is an herb?

Any plant with leaves, seeds, or flowers used for flavoring, food, medicine, or perfume.

## What is an herbalist?

Someone who uses plants for healing and nourishment and dedicates their lives to working with medicinal plants.

## What is the difference between an herb and a drug?

There are several differences. One of the main differences is that a pharmaceutical usually has one active ingredient. An herb can have an array of direct action ingredients and simple nourishment. Herbs are also used on a wider scale of potency. Some are used very lightly. Some are so potent they need to be administered by a seasoned herbalist.

## What does an herbal consultation entail?

In an herbal consultation, we get to talk about your health and about your life to get an idea of what kind of support would be best for you. This can include nourishment as well as direct action herbs. You’ll be asked questions about your physical body, about your mental health, about your life experiences. You’ll be asked about your job and your hobbies. You’ll be asked what is most important to you in this consultation. We will work together to come up with a plan that works best for you. Often we will start with several different remedies and nourishments and work together to narrow it down to a plan that works within your scope of self-care. We will talk about what is already working for you and what you can conceivably add to it.
