## Satisfied Clients

- "I’ve dealt with anxiety for the majority of my life. Due to 2020 stresses, I finally started taking medication for it, but wanted additional ‘tools’ to supplement it in a more natural way. I described my typical symptoms to Heather, and after some discussion, she made some recommendations. I put them to the test a couple days later, and was so impressed with how quickly they worked! I love knowing that I have additional effective, non-pharmaceutical options now. I would recommend her services to anyone looking for “back to the earth” treatments." - Kelsi Parenteau
