# Welcome

Iâ€™m Heather Hall, and I want to light your way as you untangle your path to health. 

What path did I take?

I learned to love plants as a child at camp.

My experience with a homebirth midwife sparked a desire in me to explore my friendship with herbs to heal myself.

I met a friend in a parenting group named Jim. Jim is an herbalist and he teaches wonderful classes. I took many more classes and came back to Jim for an in depth education. 

I have been enjoying herbs for decades. Let me show you how wonderfully they can go along with you on your path.
