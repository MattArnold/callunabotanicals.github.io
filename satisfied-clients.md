# Satisfied Clients

- "I’ve dealt with anxiety for the majority of my life. Due to 2020 stresses, I finally started taking medication for it, but wanted additional ‘tools’ to supplement it in a more natural way. I described my typical symptoms to Heather, and after some discussion, she made some recommendations. I put them to the test a couple days later, and was so impressed with how quickly they worked! I love knowing that I have additional effective, non-pharmaceutical options now. I would recommend her services to anyone looking for “back to the earth” treatments." - Kelsi Parenteau

- "I have been dealing with bad allergies since i was a kid. I was allergic to pretty much everything. That later turned into Asthma when I was spending most of my time at my girlfriend's home with her three cats. I took the usual medications, both over the counter and prescription and began getting allergy shots. They made a big difference but even so I still had lots of wheezing. Heather's knowledge of Herbalism helped me to fill the gaps in my treatments. I breathe a lot better during the day but the biggest difference has been at night. Highly recommended!" - Pete McAdam
